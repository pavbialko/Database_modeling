# Database modeling for project "Auto dealership"

## As part of the database design, the following steps were taken:
- Database modeling reflecting the topic of a car dealership, in the form of an ER diagram.
- Transformation of the diagram into a relational model (taking into account foreign keys).
- Creation of an SQL script containing CREATE TABLE commands as well as INSERT commands, which creates the designed database and populates it with sample rows.
